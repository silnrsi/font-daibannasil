Notes on Master Files
_______________________________________________________________

In addition to the eight FontLab source files used to generate the fonts, there
are four 'master' files.  These files contain the extremes of light and bold
weights, and were used to generate the intermediary weights found in some
of the other files.  The following lists the various blending ratios:

  - Light Regular: 0 (same as Master Regular)
  - Light Bold: 80
  - Book Regular: 30
  - Book Bold: 120

The italic (technically oblique) fonts were made by slanting 11 degrees to the right of their upright counterparts and, for some glyphs, re-aligning nodes at extremes.
