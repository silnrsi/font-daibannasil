Release 3.100

For the New Tai Lue (Xishuangbanna Dai) characters nothing should have changed from the previous 3.000 release.
If there are any differences, the change in build tools (and sources) would probably be the reason.
The build process for the fonts completely changed to using open sources built using open source tools.

Most of the Latin characters have been replaced. In the previous release the Latin characters were the same weight
even if the New Tai Lue (Xishuangbanna Dai) characters were a different weight.
Now a different Latin font was imported (Gentium Plus) at the correct weight (such as Bold) and style (such as Italic).
