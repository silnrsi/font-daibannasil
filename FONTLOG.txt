Dai Banna SIL Fonts
========================


This file provides detailed information on the Dai Banna SIL fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Dai Banna SIL fonts and any derivative works.


Basic Font Information
----------------------

Dai Banna SIL is a Unicode font package that supports the New Tai Lue script.  The New Tai Lue script is used by approximately 300,000 people who speak the Xishuangbanna Dai language in Yunnan, China.  It is a simplification of the Tai Tham (Old Tai Lue) script as used for this language for hundreds of years.

Version 2.200 is the latest Unicode release.  It has complete coverage of the NEW TAI LUE Unicode block (U+1980..19DF) as per Unicode 6.0.  It uses Graphite technology to support complex script behaviours like vowel reordering and intersyllabic line breaking in spaceless text.  (NB: Only basic break opportunities are accounted for in the current release.  Breaking behaviours for numbers and special CCV structures have yet to be added.)  The source package includes the source Graphite code.

Eight fonts from two typeface families are included in this release:

	DBSILLR.ttf	- Dai Banna SIL Light
	DBSILLO.ttf	- Dai Banna SIL Light Italic
	DBSILLB.ttf	- Dai Banna SIL Light Bold
	DBSILLC.ttf	- Dai Banna SIL Light Bold Italic
	DBSILBR.ttf	- Dai Banna SIL Book
	DBSILBO.ttf	- Dai Banna SIL Book Italic
	DBSILBB.ttf	- Dai Banna SIL Book Bold
	DBSILBC.ttf	- Dai Banna SIL Book Bold Italic

The original, non-Unicode font package (SIL Dai Banna) was developed with assistance from the Research Centre for the Minority Languages of China, Institute of Ethonology and Anthropology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences located in Beijing, China.

Subsequent, Unicode releases (Dai Banna SIL) were developed with valuable input from Ms. YU Kanglong, Chief Editor, Dai News Department, Xishuangbanna Daily.  Xishuangbanna Daily, established since 1957, is the largest newspaper company in Yunnan, China that publishes in the New Tai Lue script.

The Dai Banna SIL project is maintained by SIL International.
